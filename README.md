# LinkedIn AI Replacer

A Firefox extension that replaces the word **"AI"** with something more entertaining (default: **"Fart"**) — but only on LinkedIn.

## 🧠 Why?

Because LinkedIn posts about "AI" are getting out of hand, and you'd rather read about something... else.

## 🚀 Features

- Replaces standalone instances of `AI` with `fart`
- Only runs on `linkedin.com`
- Updates dynamically as the page changes

## 🛠 Installation (Temporary in Firefox)

1. Open Firefox.
2. Navigate to [`about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`](about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox).
3. Click **"Load Temporary Add-on…"**
4. Select any file in the extension directory (e.g. `manifest.json`).
5. Open [linkedin.com](https://linkedin.com) and enjoy the nonsense.

⚠️ This will disappear when you close Firefox.
